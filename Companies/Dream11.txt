1)Rate a 2D Array(N X N) by 90 degree clockwise.
  Input
  3
  3 4 7 
  7 3 0
  9 2 4 
  Output
  9 7 3
  2 3 4
  4 0 7
  
  2)There are N steps to cover for reaching destination
  at every step i there are two choices either go to i+1 step or accrding to an array s[n] where s[n] will be provided
  
  Check if we can reach destination in less tha K steps , where K will be provided
  
  INput : N=5 K=3
  s[N] = {3,4,2,1,5}
Here at Step i= 1 we have two option either go to 2 i.e i+1   or s[i] i.e 3 go to third step


Second Round : 
1)Given an array of integers print numbers which are duplicate
[1,2,2,4,4,10]

2)Given a 2-D shorted array check if a number exists in this array

1 2 3 
10 23 45
100 300 500
